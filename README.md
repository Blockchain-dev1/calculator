#### | 1)- The Task
You and your team should work together to design the algorithm and implement a Java program that works in
a similar way to a calculator                                             

#### | 2)- The Calculator should be able to perform the following operations:
1. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers [Subtask 1]
2. Power, modulo, and square/cube roots [Subtask 2]
3. Conversions between temperature units (Celsius/Fahrenheit) [Subtask 3]
4. Conversions between Metric and Imperial units for mass (g/oz) and length (cm/inches) [Subtask 4]
5. Conversion of a decimal number to binary [Subtask 5]
6. Conversion of a binary number to decimal [Subtask 6]
7. Conversion of a decimal number to hexadecimal [Subtask 7]
8. Conversion of a hexadecimal number to decimal [Subtask 8] 

In particular, the Calculator must have the following core functionalities. It must:
- Display the list of available operations and ask the user which operation they would like to perform.
- Ask the user to input the number(s).
